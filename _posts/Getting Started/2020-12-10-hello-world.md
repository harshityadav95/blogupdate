## New Blog Setup

Hello Reader , for long it has been pending on my list to create a personal portfolio website , to showcase my project , writeblogposts , twitter integration etc etc but it didnt fit well as being a software developer
and many projects being done for company there arent isnt much to show apart from some general lessons or findings as a developer  , I did try posting daily progress when i pushed the pedal to the metal for learning the machine learning in which daily become weekly to monthly , and its better writing 1 high quality post than truckload of smaller ones which stays one the internet for long with google killing so many products and blogger going so many changes , it was time to move on to github pages

### Choice of Framework for Github Static pages 
Ealier this year i gave a tried setting up jekyll (Ruby) from scratch but couldnt find the right theme to pick for , then i setup Mkdocs (python) for making my note collection and code snippets which worked well for a while but didnt fit my usecase and the Github Workflow broke after sometime i didnt get time to fix and starting using Gitbooks for notes and writing markdowns

Until December i cam across this wonderfull theme by [Cotes](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) which was the ....light bulb momenet of this was what i was looking for , should really checkout and [Sponser](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coteschung) this project and the setup and documentation is so well done i was up and running and no time 

### Discontinuing Blogger and Medium
Medium and Blogger may have better indexing and ranking in search results but Medium Signin/Paywall and free article count and google everchanging product futures seemed not so promising 

I do recommend to use  [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) , [Hashnode](https://dev.to/) for setup tutorials and general articles 

## Takeaway
-  Go opensource
-  Quality over Quantity
-  Paywalls and Signin [meh]
