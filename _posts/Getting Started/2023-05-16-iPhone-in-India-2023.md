One small post for the biggest tech fanboy moment Android vs iOS

## **First 10 days Usage iOS Shortcoming :**

- iPhones do not support the 4G Volte carrier Video Calling service in India
- The NFC in iPhones cannot be used for Visa or any other tap-to-pay terminals in India for now
- App Notification category to selectively disable is not a thing in iOS
- When picking calls and Bluetooth is paired the call is default picked on phone many times until set in settings
- While calling a number switching retrying and switching SIM card is better implemented on Android
- Weather forecast in the iOS weather app is way too inaccurate as compared to Google weather feeds in Bangalore, India
- When call connection fails hard to troubleshoot the cause vowifi/volte etc ?

## DaytoDay irks

- Whatsapp cannot send photos as documents straight forwards as one can do it in Android
- Notification mangement in iOS is boon & bane in disguise as notifications keep piling up easily without affecting screen on time
