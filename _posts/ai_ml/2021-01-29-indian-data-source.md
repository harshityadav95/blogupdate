Slide from Ai- For Everyone by Deeplearning.ai on Coursera by Andrew Ng 

Starting on my Plan to Build real-world project that serves a function [solvepao.com](https://solvepao.com) the main initial data I needed was GIS data of various coordinates of public utility like school, education, Hospitals, etc for India to start with. These Data sources for other countries are easily available online and used as learning dataset for beginner data science projects and hosted on all major public data set repository, apparently for India there is a rise in the initiative by the government to make the data publicly available, and the NIC (National Informatics Center) working on various projects to make that data more accessible but the GIS data I was looking for is only available in the public domain to preview using [Bharat Map](https://bharatmaps.gov.in) but not for download, while I was Googling for Data but I did compile a list in the process

Few really good examples to check out are : 

1. [https://stategisportal.nic.in/stategisportal](https://stategisportal.nic.in/stategisportal)
2. [https://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/bhuvan_links.php](https://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/bhuvan_links.php)
3. [https://indiabiodiversity.org/?lang=en](https://indiabiodiversity.org/?lang=en)

PS: If you look for other specific data like IRIS data for Indian citizens, street signs, handwriting, and other biomedical data that can be found on various University project sites in India 

here is compiled a list of various data sources one can check out when working on the next data science project :

## [1. Data.Gov.In](https://data.gov.in)
It publishes datasets, documents, tools, and applications collected by the government for public use and community participation of the products with visualization, APIs, alerts, etc. It is also a collection of all the government based datasets discussed Below.

## [2. National Portal of India](https://www.india.gov.in)
It was developed by the Indian government to facilitate single window access to information and services of all government entities, A single-point access to a lot of information, has a searchable contact directory, a database of the government website, and others

## [3. Ministry Of Statistics And Programme Implementation Dataset](https://www.mospi.gov.in/data)
The datasets are collected by conducting large-scale sample surveys across India for various parameters, which eventually leads to the creation of the database. The ministry applies standard statistical techniques and large inspection and supervision to enable this.

## [4. RBI Database Of Indian Economy](https://dbie.rbi.org.in/DBIE/dbie.rbi?site=home)
 It is loaded with suitable information and data for researchers, analysts, and general users all alike. It has datasets across money and banking, financial markets, national income, saving and employment, and others. The idea is to make easy present-day styles of data analysis that can provide important real-time numbers about economic activity, prices, and more.

## [5. Gateway To Indian Earth Observation](https://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/bhuvan_links.php#)
An initiative by ISRO, the open data archive(records) provides free satellite data, products download facility, and thematic datasets. It uses a crowdsourcing approach to collect enriching and point-of-interest data. It also acts as a platform to host government data such as the forest department. Apart from being a repository of data, it allows users to explore the 2D and 3D representation of the surface of the earth, pest surveillance, disaster services, high-resolution imagery of cities, among others.
