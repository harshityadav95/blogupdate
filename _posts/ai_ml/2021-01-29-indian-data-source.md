Slide from Ai- For Everyone by Deeplearning.ai on Coursera by Andrew Ng 

Starting on my Plan to Build real-world project that serves a function [solvepao.com](https://solvepao.com) the main initial data I needed was GIS data of various coordinates of public utility like school, education, Hospitals, etc for India to start with. These Data sources for other countries are easily available online and used as learning dataset for beginner data science projects and hosted on all major public data set repository, apparently for India there is a rise in the initiative by the government to make the data publicly available, and the NIC (National Informatics Center) working on various projects to make that data more accessible but the GIS data I was looking for is only available in the public domain to preview using [Bharat Map](https://bharatmaps.gov.in) but not for download, while I was Googling for Data but I did compile a list in the process

Few really good examples to check out are :
