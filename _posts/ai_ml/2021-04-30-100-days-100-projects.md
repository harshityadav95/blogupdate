Last year when I did #100daysofMLcode #100daysofcode ü§î (100 days of ML code is a subset of 100 days of code right üòÖü§£) so I saw on various other #100  days even #365 other days challenge of being consistent  working on something one likes

One interesting challenge that caught my eye was [#100daysofproject](https://the100dayproject.org/) by [@lindsayjeanthomson](https://www.instagram.com/lindsayjeanthomson/)


## Purpose

The #tag keyword  was  last 0.1% bit of push needed to take it as a challenge to widen my knowledge base every day about various tools and technology stack  by hands-on learning, to help me later in rapid prototyping of ideas and side projects (maybe better system designs too ? ), otherwise once in office work these things take a back seat and broaden the knowledge base of tools and tricks helps in a lot of places over time and lastly, 1-2 hrs of the day before sleep are spent scrolling Twitter or Youtube, with multiple tabs that just get saved for next day, it's said to pick a habit of reading before bed every day why not the habit of hands-on and learning something every day


## Rules I followed

- create a project every day without a miss
- a project could be: an app, a component, a website, a game, a library, hands-on tutorial following a youtube video or some guided tutorial anything, etc 
- the task has to be done before the end of day every day for next 100 Days


## How to come with so many ideas or Projects?

It‚Äôs simple: I am a genius üòé. ?

Just kidding ?... I‚Äôm far from being that.

The truth is over the years I have gathered a lot of interesting projects, posts, articles tutorials that I want to work on but never get to start them. and gathering and looking back to these projects and idea collection gives me an even more creative idea

Also, doing this creative process over and over and over, you end up eventually getting ideas from all the things around you. There are some projects that I want to do because I see a need in my day-to-day life (those app ideas you get while brushing your teeth and before sleep) or the major mental roadblock you get when an idea comes up in head how to get it done/start with or to make that?

For beginning with, thanks to my University providing students with [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/programs/manipal-education-tguaf) subscription, so all of the projects will be guided projects which will be helpful in learning and act as boilerplate templates and get in the flow.


## How much work did it take to create a project?

Some of the projects I did in under 30 minutes, a couple took me 2-3 hours and 1 or 2 I had to ‚Äúpostpone‚Äù to the 2nd day because I couldn‚Äôt finish them. Although I postponed these projects to the next day, I recreated them from scratch - only using the gained knowledge. This turned out to be a good way to get "unstuck". Just redo it from scratch.

I would say that I needed around 1-1.5 hours on average per day. This includes: watching the hands-on guided material, setup & installation, and googling stuff, and coding it out.

Keep in mind that I‚Äôve been coding since 2014, so topics I chose or the tech stack I opted for can vary from a wide variety of topics, but it depends on what interests you or what project you have in mind.


## What motivated me to keep going?

Even after a Masters Degree and more than 1 year worth of industry experience in R&D projects so many variables and unknown in my head existed in my mind map whenever I think of an app idea or project or some software product that curiosity of how does that work or how is that done keeps me going.

## What did I learned during the challenge?

Apart from all the tech tools and tricks, there was a period in which there was information overload with too much diverse learning every day in too many domains, and all information was just getting harder to stitch together so I learned how to Learn [ Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/HC56V4WN8CYG?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=course) which was good and I every college should keep it as optional or recommend or teach students how to learn before teaching. The course gave me amazing insights into how the mind works and how to improve and use it better, the course is free I recommend anyone who has a tiny bit of interest in how mind and thoughts work should check it out, that course helped me form a better mental model or scaffolding for future learning.


## What would you do differently?

If I had to do this whole thing differently will make a project that is public and would want to probably screen record in the tutorial or share code or blog post for individual projects others can follow through


## Should people do this challenge?

If you have been wanting to learn something or form a habit and it been on the waitlist forever start with a friend or pick it as a challenge to get it done

## What‚Äôs next for Me?

Probably launch the public beta of my side project before the end of this year ü§û.

DSA , ML ? , .NET Core  ? lets see
