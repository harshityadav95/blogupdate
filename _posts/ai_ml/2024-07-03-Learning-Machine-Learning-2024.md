## Relearning Machine Learning 2024

Many times i come across this question by folks of all age groups and domains , that if they want to get started into machine learning or just want to know whats goes inside when we say the term machine learning or are using ChatGPT or some other AI tool or AI powered product in day to day life . The answer to question varies each time depending the domain of the person and how deep they can go without loosing interest so thought to write and article and refine it over time to keep it as general and simple as possible
