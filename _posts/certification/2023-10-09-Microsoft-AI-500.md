# 4 Down 2 to Go ðŸ˜Ž

One more check on the bucket list as I learn more and am one step closer to the end goal of becoming Azure Solutions Architect Expert 

## Preparation

-  Among all the Azure certifications I have prepared for and studied this one one mix of bags ranging from Virtual networks, NSG to Azure AD
-  As much experience as one can have in the practical side of Azure AD topics and roles were the ones I had to memorize
-  Preparation included going through the MS Learn Study material, followed by the MS Sample test and then question banks

## Practise Question Source

The included question is sufficient to pass with an above 700+ score but the answers to questions available in the question bank are wrong at places so do lookout for answer reasoning if you are in doubt

- [Source 2](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/az-500/)

## Taking the Exam
- The exam had 55 questions to be done in 1hr 3o min minutes which I found a bit short and had to skip on a few lengthy questions for the end to cover all the questions in time
