# First Car Mahindra 3xo 2024 Part

## Requirements 

- Should have good saftey rating and past record
- Should have automatic transmission to face bangalore traffic as well as traffic in ghats for roadtrips
- Should have head room space for 6'1 height in all seats
- Should have a cabin insulation and lower NVH levels 
- High Speed stability and ground clearence to drive around the Tier1 Pothole City
- On road price should not cross 15 Lakh INR for on Road in Bangalore ( excluding accessories )


## MG and VW

- Liked the road pressence and looks of Astor but the fuel efficency and the service availability across India ruled it out , same for Virtus fuel efficency and seeing the roads and traffic in bangalore would not justify what the car is made for  

## Toyota

- No options fitting the criteria , evaluated Fronx instead of Taisor

## Tata

Have friends that own nexon and the unique problems it get into is an example of its own kind every time , plus the A pillar was  too big of blind spot and bucket seats for driver didnt felt comfortable for long drives

## Maruti Suzuki

- XL6 Good option but brother declated it as Taxi class vechile

- Grand Vitara chcked all the boxes but suprisingly the boot space was more then required but leg room space for middle passenger in back and middle bump was too big that couldnt even move leg across from one side to another

- Brezza Automatic in Bangalore had way to much tax not making for it pros
- Fronx was one of options i test drove again before going to final booking for mahindra but same height restriction in the back seat for tall person and interior felt too light after getting the taste of 3xo

#### Pros
- The Ride comfort in front seats , armrest on both the sides for driver
- Performance in the Sports mode , drove 0-120 was just awesome
- Camera Integreation and views avaialble and soft touch buttons for essential feature on console is huge advantage
- Build quality and visibility compared to nexon
- Ground Clearance and cabin NVH levels
  
#### Cons
- Leg space available in back seat for tall person , not the right fit for me
- Sunroof motor placement in roof has big bump in the roof for rear passenger if 3 people are sitting
- Feedback and intutiveness of the gear selector dial is poor
- Frunk Installation is add-on
- Plastic near wireless charger can be improved
- Horn volume and sensitivty is dead at corners and need to pressed in middle
- Tata service and dealrship experience right from first contact of pricing and test drive was not good and hearing about incidents from colleagues 

## Honda

- Honda amaze was my choice checked all the boxes but interior in 2022 model looked outdated rest the engine refinment and everything is simply-amazing
- The engine
- Honda City , Honda amaze driver seat felt more comfortable
- Elevate , Big car but interior did not felt spacy for the price but good option AMT version did exceed budget considering the tax differerne in Karntaka

## Hyundai
- Venue , back seat passenger leg room space was less rest car was good
- Creta Automatic crossed the spend threshold

## Kia 
Kia Sonnet was in competition with 3xo in terms of pricing headspace , legroom and feature offering but the NVH levels of engine made the vechile feel sporty with a character but at same time the noise levels was something i wanted as minimal as possible to make daily commute and traffic jams more berable and the lack of safety rating ruled it out

## Winner : Mahindra 

### Getting a Test Drive on Xuv 3xo

Tried booking through there website , worked flawlessly , got a person assigned on the day of booking being told to postpone for a day but got the test drive on time , and car slowly started checking all my boxes with 100s of youtube videos reviews , my own expereince previous generation 300 reviews and 3xo enginnering presentation at launch presentation was something i as person appreciated more when buying a product rather then showing marketing keywords with no numbers in a launch 
Took 3 drives at Different showrooms across bangalore all automatic and all MX3 pro or AX5 varients

### Note to Mahindra  on Test Drives 
Know your audience in the test drive and what they are looking for , the car has personality  for both smooth silent and comfortable city rides which can handles all the bumpes and potholes with ease at same time it has the SUV characters in its DNA to jump on palces where there are no proper roads and high speed fun , so tha person giving demo should consider this while giving demo rides and accordingly set the zip,zap,zoom mode so the rides are what the person is looking for as in one of my test rides the ride was so bumpy and with hard braking and start pushes the drive didnt feel comfortable as the demo was set in zoom mood and when i got the car which almost made me doubt the comfort factor of the car

## Dealership Expereince 
Dealership expereince was good at all 3 Showrooms be it follow ups and test drive availability for car and the sales representative knowledge of the vechile ( better then Nexa and Kia and Honda )  

Finally booked my Car on
