### Background
During college days seeing our canteen, to Xerox wale bhaiya printing money sabka plan ya cost calculation toh zaroor hota no_customer X order_Value X 365 , motivated by that and our love for tasty food and passion for cooking we thought why not give it a try and set up our own Food Startup for a day and experience it , with countless hours on planning and gathering required materials keep expenses minimal to getting the right recipe one which we love to eat ourselves and would like to sell 300 plates of same.

## R&D Food Lab
We had an awesome time getting the perfect taste that beats 90% of nachos and desert shots one can get in a cafe , taste tested with the target crowd and calculated the ingredients and recipes and cost down to single gram

## Our Findings from the Adventure 
With our learning and lessons in all domains at every aspect from teamwork, coordination , planning , ordering system, logistics, and food science to optimising our order here are a few highlights  being an engineer i found interesting 

- Food Order systems are cool to design and overengineered , tricky to implement in real and real-time
- Even with UPI in place , the limitations for average users are not known and also there is not even a single free UPI APP that could announce money received
- Feature need to broadcast UPI transactions across multiple users for , like for account activity messages and share the transaction to various people in a group, an API endpoint for a UPI ID maybe 
- Reading the labels on food and what all they add in processed food
- You can get a Truck faster and more easily than a cab in Bangalore
- Refrigeration is an interesting problem statement
- R&D expenses are something to keep track on
- Everyone has a unique take on everything to learn , identifying the best person for a task is efficient

Let's see what our entrepreneurial spririt takes us in 2025

I know the writeup is small and does not do justice to the adventure and fun and learning , though every bit of what I could save is saved up somewhere,  if you want to chat about how we pulled this off without even having access to Fire and living in PG that's what real-world problem-solving skills are :P
