## Pre Delivery Inspection 

The Dealer clearly told that there are no third party inspections allowed , so made a checklist and checked everything in detail as i could

### Observations 

1. (Will check with Mahindra if something can be done about it  )One Major thing that i checked and noticed that time and thought it was a software thing later found it was a hardware issue the down click of seek button in sterring button is faulty.
2. All the back Headlights corners are brushed off during fitting and factory handling
3. The body pannel gaps in front were good but at the back are misalligned in the left part of car and in every 3xO in stockyard
4. The plastic edges in inner door pannes as well as rubber seals around gate and window could have better quality and finish
