## Observation 

- The Suspension and driving experience for the front passengers and back passengers are really different while riding in a car when going over pot holes and rough patches of road the driver can go in speed not feeling a thing meanwhile people will in back will have roller coaster so that should be kept in mind
- Driving in Zap mode in city when not in >5  min  of stand still traffic will give more mileage then Zip mode in city when there is moving traffic will test this more in city
- Felt the need for tint in Bangalore
- Zoom mood should definitely be avoided in city as the steering wheels weighs up and the accelerations are more responsive
