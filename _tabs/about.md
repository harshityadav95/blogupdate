I am a Software Engineer focusing on infrastructure, platforms, Linux, open source software, Geospatial Computing , distributed computing (Kubernetes), High Performance Computing , containerization, and the cloud

I have worked in many different languages and platforms but currently that is primarily Java , Python, Go, and shell scripting.

My non-computer passions are reading, cooking, DIY , and binge-watching. Reach out to me (email address below) if you have any questions about these types of things, or just want to chat!
